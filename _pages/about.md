Hi 😊！

My name is Jiahui Liu, and I am a third-year student at the School of Computer Science, Central South University.I enjoy playing board games, watching movies, anime, and etc.

Previously, under the guidance of Yishuo Cai(https://walkeralan123.github.io/), I explored **MLLM Reasoning**, especially **"Think with images."** In the future, I hope to explore more areas, such as **unified multimodal generation and understanding, VLA, and world models.** I hope to communicate with more people and do more interesting work.😄
